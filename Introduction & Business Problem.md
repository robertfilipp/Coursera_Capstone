### Introduction & Business Problem

Artisan Roasteries is an upscale, luxury chain of coffee shops in New York City. They currently operate 21 stores across multiple Manhattan neighborhoods: Financial District, Tribeca, Upper East Side, Chelsea, and Lincoln Square, to name just a few. The company’s mission is to “empower every human being one cup of coffee at the time”, which they diligently follow by their customer and quality-centric culture and business operations. 

The current annual revenue per location is approximately $500,000, making their total annual revenue about $11 million. Artisan Roasteries employ 103 employees directly and support another 5,000 employees through their supply chain and vendor relations. Artisan Roasteries offer a wide array of coffee products to their customers, from core products like black coffee, lattes, and cappuccinos, to more complex offerings like exotic coffee blends and artisan roasting techniques.

Artisan Roasteries approached us with a request for help. In the next 6 to 12 months, they are planning to expand to another U.S. market. After careful considerations, they selected Chicago and Los Angeles as the two most suitable locations for expansion. They need a market analysis report, focusing on spatial and location-based data in these two cities, with two objectives:
1. Compare and contract these cities and choose the one most suitable for Artisan Roasteries expansion based on similarities to New York City, the city’s neighborhoods, and relative abundance or lack of coffee shops.
2. Based on the data above, select five neighborhoods in the most suitable city to open the first five coffee shops, based on the nature and feel of those neighborhoods, existing businesses and amenities, and other competing coffee shops.

The final report should clearly describe each city, list similarities and differences to New York City, list most important city neighborhoods, existing businesses, and other competing coffee shops. While the report and the analysis should employ various data science techniques and methodology, the report must be written concisely, with non-data science audience in mind.
