### Data

To conduct our analysis and provide the client with the best business recommendations, we will use publicly available location data and information through Foursquare database. We will use this data to map and analyze different areas and neighborhoods of New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles. We will also model and cluster these neighborhoods using machine learning algorithms, to create clusters of similar neighborhoods in these cities, based on existing businesses and amenities. Finally, we will analyze relative density of competing coffee shops and chains, to avoid areas with saturated markets, which could lead to lower-than-expected revenue levels.

Such a detailed market analysis will help Artisan Roasteries to decide which market to penetrate first, and where to open the first five coffee shop locations.
